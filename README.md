# KAtlas: The Reverse-ATS Protocol
### AI for Bharat Hackathon | Phase 1: Strategic Architecture

> **"Stop guessing. Start hitting."** — The KAtlas Mission.

## 01. The Brief
Current hiring systems are built on an "AI Arms Race" that auto-rejects 87% of qualified Indian Business Analysts due to semantic mismatches. **KAtlas** is the intervention. We are building the infrastructure layer to kill the PDF resume format and replace it with a verified, machine-readable protocol.

## 02. Protocol Documentation (Phase 1 Submission)
To be eligible for shortlisting and AWS credits, please review the specific technical assets below:

* 📂 **[Requirements Protocol](./requirements.md):** Problem statement, USP, and the "Golden Dataset" strategy.
* 📂 **[Technical Design](./design.md):** Cloud-native architecture, logic layers, and the semantic pivot engine.

## 03. The Architecture
Built on **AWS (Mumbai Region)** for maximum performance and security.

* **Logic Layer:** Amazon Bedrock (Claude 3.5 Sonnet) for semantic reasoning.
* **Compute:** AWS Lambda for serverless, event-driven processing.
* **Storage:** S3 for encrypted dossier storage and DynamoDB for state management.
* **Intelligence:** Custom "Clinical Handler" model trained on outcome-labeled transformation data.

## 04. Vision 2030
We are transitioning the Indian labor market from a "Black Hole" of rejection into a high-liquidity talent network. Our goal is to unlock ₹50,000Cr of trapped human capital by standardizing the way talent is verified and matched.
